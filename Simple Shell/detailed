A little bit about how this project has been done:
- By using the function strtok(), the command gets seperated into many tokens and set in
the args[] array.
- Here I also declare sp_arg variable to store a special symbol, which is <, >, or |. Along
with sp_arg, there is also remaining variable that is used to store what goes after the special
symbol.
- The count variable is declared for, of course, counting and after that will be used to
specify available cases.
- The cpy_cmd variable is used to duplicate the command from stdin, it copies the original
command right after users input. Because the command, after getting parsed by strtok(), will
not be the same, so it is necessary to use this variable for history_buffer after that.
- The shell can also indicate that the input is invalid, and skip to next input if there is an
Enter key too.
